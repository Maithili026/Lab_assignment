      <p>
      I may pretend to be a know-it-all, but not a single day passes when I don’t seek your advice. 
      You have always been my idol. When I was little, I always wanted to copy you in everything. 
      I wanted to talk like you, dress dress like you, and walk like you. You are the most beautiful woman in the world to me! 
      Did you know that whenever my friends would say, “your mom is gorgeous,” my heart would swell with pride?
      I am sorry for arguing, fighting, and screaming at you at times. You have tolerated all my door-slams, tantrums, and silent treatments with a smile – and sometimes tears, which broke my heart. 
      Even though I have behaved like a problem child, you were nothing but a perfect mother to me. 
      Thank you for everything you have done for me, mommy.
      <br><br>
      Your loving daughter,
      <br>
